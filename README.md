# Flutter Animations - Hands-On Lab

This repository serves as a personal hands-on lab for learning and experimenting with Flutter's animation widgets. The code here is my own implementation of the examples and concepts found in the official Flutter documentation.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of Flutter's animation system by actively coding along with the official guide on [Animation and motion widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets/animation). It's a practical way for me to learn.

Feel free to explore the code, but please note that this is a learning project and not a production-ready library.
